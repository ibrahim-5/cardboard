# cardboard
A 'ðŸ“¦-inspired' Interpreted Language Implemented In Go

# Example Script

``cardboard`` follows a simple ``C``-like syntax structure, without being a strictly typed language. 

An example code script can be seen below:

```
< Function Declaration >
box add(a, b) {
    put y = a + b
    unbox y
}

< Variable Declaration >
put x = 10
put y = 20 - 15

< Printing To Output >
show(add(x, y))
```

The design focus for ``cardboard`` is simplicity and ease of use. 

# Development Plans
Developing programming languages is an interest I wish to experiment with, and therefore ``cardboard`` will always be in development! 

The following is a subset of the ideas I wish to implement in the language:

- [ ] Variable Declarations
- [ ] Arithmetic Operations
- [ ] Function Declarations
- [ ] Printing Functionality
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Constants
- [ ] Structs / Classes

# Contribution
It would be really cool if you could fork this Repo and work on new features! I'll be happy to merge them right away ðŸ˜€
